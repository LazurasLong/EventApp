# EventApp
I wrote this Progressive web app for our wedding and had it deployed on cloud platform Digital Ocean at that time. 

It reads data/content from mongo to display dynamic data and has pages/abilities like 
  Home
  Directions
  Gift Registry(list of all places, url redirect only and not fully integrated like a Knot registry import)
  RSVP form for guests
  spring boot security enabled RSVP report/guest viewer for admin to login and filter/browse at real time.
  
This can be extended to have guest list and any other pages by reusing ui templates 

and adding simple spring boot JPA or using an existing DAO as needed.

As the groom, Charlie Mehrer worked on cleaning up css and enhancing UI
